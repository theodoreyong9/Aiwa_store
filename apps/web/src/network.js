// The wallet's network: ONE transport made of the two ways it meets other wallets, which feed the same log.
//   by itself: the wallets that are open join a room (Trystero, through a public relay that sees only that someone looks for
//              peers) and a direct connection opens to each of them: nobody swaps a code, there is no server of ours;
//   by hand:   two phones side by side swap two codes (link.js), for when no relay can be reached.
// Once it has some peers a wallet no longer needs the room: it asks them to introduce it to theirs (Introducer), which opens direct
// connections of its own, and with enough of those it leaves the room (PeerManager). A machine that is always on stays in the room, so
// that a newcomer always finds someone.
// Persistence is another matter (a wallet that nobody holds is gone with its phone): it is for machines that stay connected.
