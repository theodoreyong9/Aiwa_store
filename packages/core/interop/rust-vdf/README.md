# rust-vdf — a real cross-runtime interoperability demonstration

Not a port of aiwa-core to Rust — a real, independent implementation
of specific, real pieces of the protocol's own custom logic: the
sequential VDF hash chain (`vdf.js`), a real, fully signed event's own
canonical id (`event.js` — this project's ACTUAL, current, wider
format: `domain`/`author`/`authorPublicKey`/`parents`/`type`/`payload`
/`createdAt`, not just a bare `{parents,payload}` pair), a real Ed25519
signature over that exact event, independently re-derived by a
genuinely different library (`ed25519-dalek`, never this project's own
`@noble/curves`), the weighted median (`weighted-median.js`),
Conservation's own split invariant (`conservation.js`, real 18-decimal
amounts), Mirror's own reception monotonicity (`mirror.js`),
relative-rate's own central ratio (`relative-rate.js`), Causal Tick's
own consistency check (`causal-tick.js`), the real, *practical*
Wesolowski verification (`wesolowski-vdf.js`/`bigint-math.js`) —
including real prime-derivation and Miller-Rabin primality testing,
the one path an external, gas-constrained chain would genuinely use,
never the raw symmetric chain — and the real reward formula's own Q128
fixed-point core (`reward.js`'s `rewardFixed`, backed by
`fixed-point-math.js`) — a real, from-scratch BigInt ln/exp/pow, never
`Math.log`/`Math.pow`, since IEEE 754 only guarantees `+,-,*,/` agree
bit-for-bit across runtimes, never transcendental functions, and
`reward()`'s own output funds a real, on-chain AIWA claim
(`accrual.js`) — each written directly from the same real
specification, never by wrapping or transpiling the JS.

The checks cover `vdf.js`, `weighted-median.js`, `conservation.js`'s split invariant, `mirror.js`'s monotonicity check,
`relative-rate.js`'s central ratio, `causal-tick.js`'s consistency check, `wesolowski-vdf.js`, `bigint-math.js` and
`reward.js`/`fixed-point-math.js`, and `event.js`'s canonical id format (`coreBytes()`) — together with a real, independently
re-signed Ed25519 signature. This is the cross-runtime check described in the Yellow Paper (§16.1).

`test/rust-interop.test.mjs` builds this, runs it, and compares its
real output against the real, live aiwa-core JS modules' own output
for the identical test vectors — byte for byte. That test is the
actual proof; this directory is what it verifies.

## Running it yourself

```
cargo build --release
./target/release/vdf-interop
```

Prints a real JSON object with every value below. Compare them against
`computeVdfChain`, `createEvent`/`verifyEvent`, `weightedMedian`,
`checkCausalConsistency`, `evaluate`/`verify`, and `rewardFixed` in
`src/` for the same inputs (see
`test/rust-interop.test.mjs` for the exact vectors) — they match
exactly.

## What this does and does not claim

**Does**: prove that this protocol's own most fundamental, real
computations — a real, sequential SHA-256 chain, a real, fully signed
event's own canonical id (this project's ACTUAL current format, not a
simplified stand-in), and the reward formula's own real Q128
fixed-point arithmetic core — are specified precisely enough to
reproduce byte-for-byte in a genuinely different language and runtime.
This is what makes the claim "the transport, the runtime, the
implementation never enter into the value" a real, checked property
rather than an assertion. The event/signature check in particular is a
genuinely stronger claim than mere signature *verification*: Ed25519
signing is deterministic (RFC 8032), so the identical real secret key
signing the identical real message must produce a byte-identical
signature in any correct, conforming implementation — checked here
directly, not just that a signature happens to verify.

**Does not**: claim this is a full or even partial Rust port of
aiwa-core. `rewardFixed`'s own arithmetic core is covered — the
surrounding event-sourcing state machine (`accrual.js`'s own
`applyAccrualEvent`/position tracking/rejection handling), `wallet.js`,
`progression.js`'s own epoch-advancement bookkeeping, `data-store.js`,
`materializer.js`, and every other real piece of the protocol beyond
what's listed above, exist only in `src/` (JavaScript). A genuine
multi-runtime implementation of the whole protocol would be a real,
separate, substantial undertaking — this demonstrates the specific
claims that undertaking would depend on being true, not the whole
thing.

`contract-registry.js`'s own verification was considered for the same
treatment and found to be real orchestration over
primitives already covered above (Ed25519 checks, SHA-256 hashing)
rather than new mathematical or cryptographic computation of its
own — reimplementing it here would mostly re-verify what's already
independently checked.

## A real, practical note on toolchain versions

Some real dependencies here (`ed25519-dalek`, and transitively
`zeroize`/`base64ct`) require a genuinely recent Rust edition that
older `rustc` versions don't support. `Cargo.toml` pins
`ed25519-dalek = "2"` with `zeroize = "=1.7.0"` and
`base64ct = "=1.6.0"` — real, known-compatible versions with `rustc`
1.75.0 and later. If building with a genuinely newer toolchain, these
pins can likely be relaxed; kept conservative here for real, broad
reproducibility rather than assuming everyone's local `rustc` is
current.
