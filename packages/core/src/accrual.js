// Composes progression.js and reward.js into a real position per
// domain: committed capital b, and the epoch of the domain's own last
// action (an accrual or a claim) — never a caller-supplied value,
// always derived from the domain's own real, independently folded
// progression, exactly the "recompute, don't trust" discipline this
// project applies everywhere else. A caller providing its own
// reference epoch would let anyone claim t=currentEpoch forever.
//
// t (time since the last action) resets on every accrual or claim —
// the reward formula rewards patience since you last touched your own
// position, not since genesis. A (domainAge, the denominator
// reference) never resets — it is the domain's own total progression,
// regardless of how often it claims.
//
// "Last action" mining: the position is
// what the domain's LAST action left it.
// 'accrual': { domain, b, T } — a burn's commitment. It REPLACES the
// position: b is the capital that now mines (b = burned x (1 - T)), T the
// patience rate chosen at this burn for what follows. Before replacing, the
// claimable accrued so far is PAID (an automatic claim, credited to the
// domain's balance): a new burn never forfeits what the previous one earned.
// It resets the patience clock.
// 'claim': { domain, amount } — computes what is currently claimable from
// the real position, debits up to that amount into a real bigint balance,
// resets the patience clock. T stays the one chosen at the last burn.
//
// Both require a real Ed25519 signature proving the real signer
// controls `domain` — exactly the same signerPubkey/signature-vs-owner
// discipline wallet.js's own 'transfer'/'split' already apply, mirrored
// here because adapt-event.js's toReducerEvent strips the outer event
// envelope's real `author` before any reducer ever sees it (by design,
// so reducers stay pure {id, parents, payload} functions — see its own
// header). Without this, 'claim'/'accrual' were the one pair of event
// types checked only against economic state, never against who
// actually signed the envelope: anyone could submit a real 'claim' or
// 'accrual' naming an unrelated domain, and it would be honored as if
// the real owner had submitted it. Not a theft — the resulting balance
// or claim still lands under, and is spendable only by, the named
// domain's real key — but it let anyone reset that domain's own
// patience clock (lastActionEpoch below) without consent, a real,
// narrow griefing vector against the T (patience) bonus in reward.js.
