// Mining evidence a wallet hands to an app — a registry, a leaderboard, anything that must rank or pay by a domain's
// mining without trusting the wallet — and what the app does with it. Turnkey: an app keeps its own storage and
// policy (what a figure is worth, who may publish), and gets the protocol part from here.
//
//   evidence    { version, domain, afterEpoch, events, witnesses }   (aiwa-lib: wallet.submissionEvidence())
//   baseline    { domain, epoch, head, state }    what the app derived for this domain last time, kept as is
//   witnessed   [{ id, epoch }]                   what other wallets hold of this domain (see below)
//
//   assessSubmission(...)    verifies the evidence and derives the mining state (assessMining) — burns confirmed by
//                            THIS reader, chained from the baseline — and checks the witnesses.
//   ingestWitnesses(...)     which of the witnesses a submission brings about OTHER domains are worth keeping.
//   mergeWitnessStore(...)   the store with those added, bounded, and what has since been validated dropped.
//
// WHY WITNESSES. The mining events of a domain are one signed chain (accrual.js): an action cannot be left out of a
// history, and proven work cannot be re-signed over another one for free. That is not "no second history": a domain
// can keep two, redoing the work, and show only the favourable one. Someone else holding the other closes it: a
// wallet that received a domain's events can show the highest progression event of it that it holds — SIGNED BY THAT
// DOMAIN, which is what makes it a proof, with no trust in whoever shows it. The app keeps it, and when the domain
// next submits, the history shown must contain it. A fork, a stretch of work cut short, or a hidden action followed
// by more work is then refused.
//
// What it does not give. A witness exists only if someone received those events. A burn made after the last epoch
// shown and followed by none can still be left out: a submission is a snapshot, not "the current state" (that needs
// a clock — e.g. the head anchored on Solana). A domain whose history was really forked (one key, two devices) is
// refused for good once its other history is witnessed.
