// A domain's position, from BOTH kinds of evidence, each used for what it is good at.
//
// - Proofs (triangulation.js): what observers provably received. They set a floor, and they alone may
// ACCUSE — a rewind or a fork — because the evidence of an accusation is an event anyone can check.
// - The weighted median (causal-tick.js): where observers' committed capital says the domain is. It is an
// estimate, never an accusation: enough weight on an old view moves it, and "far from the median" cannot
// tell inflation from legitimate offline progress.
//
// position = max(median, proven lower bound) — the vote is never reported below what is proven;
// with no funded observer at all, the proven bound alone.
// accuse = contradicted || forked — from proofs only.
//
// What counts as evidence (`verifyChain`):
// 'auto' (default) — if the reader holds the target's history from epoch 1, its progression events are
// REPLAYED through the reducer and only the accepted ones count (signature, chain, sequential
// proof: what anyone who verifies does); otherwise only the signature of each event is checked, and the
// result says so (`verification: 'signature'`) — a partial log cannot be chained, and a reader in that
// position is trusting more.
// 'require' — replay always; a reader without the genesis gets nothing accepted.
// 'off' — signature only.
// Both rules see the same, filtered events, so a fake far-ahead event — forged by someone else, or signed by
// the target itself without doing the work — moves neither, and observers whose only evidence was such an
// event contribute nothing. Forks are the exception, on purpose: a second lineage is rejected by the linear
// chain, and is exactly the evidence of one, so forks are read from the signed events.
//
// Status: EXPERIMENTAL — see experiments/triangulation-scenarios.mjs for what it was compared on, and for what
// it does not cover: independence of observers, freshness beyond the freshest honest observer, and colluders
// when the reader cannot replay the chain.
