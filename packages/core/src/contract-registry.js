// A real, general mechanism — not specific to any one contract — for
// publishing a contract's own real identity as an ordinary event in
// the same log everything else already lives in. No new
// infrastructure: event.js's own content-addressing (its own
// computeEventId) is the entire mechanism. Once published and
// received by other domains (via replication, like any other real
// event), a contract's own id is immutable in the identical, real
// sense every other event already is — not because of any new
// guarantee, but because this is simply what appending an event has
// always meant here.
//
// This deliberately does not create a single, network-enforced
// "canonical registry." Multiple, real, competing contracts can
// coexist under different names, each with its own real, verifiable
// identity — wallets and users choose which to trust, exactly like
// there is no single "true" token contract on any existing chain.
