// A domain's own progression epoch advances only through a valid
// transition: monotonic (+1 exactly), causally chained to the domain's
// last accepted transition, carrying a sequential VDF proof (see
// vdf.js) — bounding the RATE of advancement, not calendar time — AND,
// like every other event type that changes a domain's own economic
// state, an Ed25519 signature proving the signer controls
// `domain`.
//
// THE GAP THIS CLOSES, found the same way accrual.js's own
// 'claim'/'accrual' gap was: the VDF proof alone is NOT a proof
// of who submitted it — vdfSeed(domain, previousOutput) is a public,
// deterministic function of values already visible to anyone watching
// the log, so anyone (not just the domain owner) can compute the exact
// same next-epoch vdfOutput and publish it as a 'progression' event
// naming that domain. Not a theft — the resulting epoch is exactly
// what the owner's own hardware would have produced — but it lets
// anyone advance a domain's own qTotal (domainAge, reward.js's own
// denominator reference) without consent, at zero cost to themselves
// beyond the sequential VDF work. Verified directly against
// reward.js's own formula: reward(b=100, q=1, qTotal, T=0) drops
// from ~0.087 at qTotal=1 to ~0.0097 at qTotal=20000 — a real,
// permanent, roughly 9x griefing reduction in a domain's own future
// reward per accrual, since domainAge never resets. Signer-scoped from
// here on, mirroring accrual.js's own buildSignedAccrualEvent/
// verifyAccrualAuthorization exactly (adapt-event.js's own
// toReducerEvent strips the outer event envelope's `author`
// before any reducer ever sees it, by design — see its own header —
// so this embeds its own inner signature the identical way).
//
// Events here use this package's own internal convention: {id,
// parents, payload}, with payload.type — see adapt-event.js for the
// bridge from event.js's own wire event shape.

 * never again match a parent.
 *

 * does have two causal dependencies — the log's current
