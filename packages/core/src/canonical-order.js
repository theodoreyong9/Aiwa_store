// The order in which a reader folds events into state, the same for every reader that holds the same events.
//
// A log is a graph: two events that do not know of each other (two branches) have no order of their own. That rarely
// matters; it does when they contradict each other (one claim spent twice, one voucher redeemed twice, one claim id
// taken by two domains): whichever is folded first wins. Folded in arrival order, two readers with the same events could
// pick different winners for good.
//
// canonicalOrder removes that. Among the events that can come next (every parent already placed) the smallest id goes
// first: a topological order, identical whatever order the events were handed in or arrived in.
//
// It is agreement, not fairness: the winner is the smaller id, which is arbitrary (nothing here has a clock), and a
// signer who writes two contradicting events can try variants until the one he wants has the smaller id. What stays is
// the proof that he wrote both: two valid signatures on contradicting events. Yellow paper §11.2.
