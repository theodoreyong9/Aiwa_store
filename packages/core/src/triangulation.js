// Triangulation of a domain's position: what observers can PROVE about it, with no weight.
//
// A Mirror reception commitment does not carry an opinion, it carries a REFERENCE: "I received this event
// of X". The reference resolves, in the DAG, to the progression event that fixes its epoch — an event only
// X's key can sign. So an observation is a PROOF that X got at least that far, not a vote on where X is.
// Three consequences, none of which needs a weight:
//
// - lowerBound: the highest epoch of X that any observer provably received. One honest observer is
// enough to establish it; any number of observers who saw less cannot lower it, and nobody can raise
// it — only X produces new evidence about X.
// - contradiction: if X reports an epoch BELOW that bound, X contradicts its own signed history. The
// evidence is the witnessing event, checkable by anyone.
// - fork: two progression events of X held by observers, neither an ancestor of the other, are two
// histories of X from one identity (a progression must chain to the last accepted one). Also provable.
//
// Every progression event it relies on is re-checked (`isAuthentic`, by default the signature check of
// progression.js: signed by the key whose id is the domain). An event that fails is dropped and reported in
// `rejected` — this is what closes the hole an earlier version of this file had, where an event attributed
// to X but forged by someone else, admitted by a log that did not check, raised the bound for free.
//
// What it cannot do — stated rather than hidden:
// - It gives no UPPER bound. A domain that progressed offline is legitimately ahead of everything any
// observer saw; `ahead` reports how far, and does not call it wrong.
// - It is only as fresh as the freshest observer who really received something. Observers can carry
// evidence or withhold it; they cannot forge it.
// - It says nothing about whether observers are distinct actors. `observers` counts distinct identities and
// is informational only — a coalition inflates it for free. Independence is a separate question.
// - By default it checks the signature on the progression event, not its sequential (VDF) proof; the
// chain check (replayProgression) does both, and assessPosition uses it whenever the reader holds the
// domain's history from epoch 1.
//
// Status: EXPERIMENTAL. Exercised on the synthetic worlds of experiments/triangulation-scenarios.mjs, not on
// networks.
