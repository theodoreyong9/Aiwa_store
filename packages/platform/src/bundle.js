// Publishing a real, multi-file application bundle (an entire app —
// index.html, css/, js/ — not just one contract's source string, the
// way aiwa-core's own contract-registry.js does for a single file) as
// verifiable, content-addressed AIWA events, so a peer can receive,
// verify, and reconstruct it via replication alone — no GitHub Pages,
// no fixed hosting for the app's own bytes.
//
// Two kinds of event, deliberately different in shape:
//
// - `bundle.file`: one per file, PARENTLESS and createdAt=0 on
//   purpose. A file's own bytes don't causally depend on when or by
//   whom they were published — only their content does, and content
//   addressing already captures that. Fixing createdAt removes the
//   one real source of non-determinism event.js's own id computation
//   would otherwise have, so publishing the SAME file content again
//   (an unchanged file across two app versions) yields the identical
//   event id and is a real no-op (`EventLog.append`'s own dedup) —
//   never retransmitted or restored twice. HONEST LIMIT: this only
//   dedups a byte-identical file; a one-byte change is a wholly new
//   event, same as any other content-addressed store.
// - `bundle.manifest`: the real, signed, timestamped "domain X
//   publishes app version Y, consisting of these exact files"
//   statement. Its parents are every real file event it references
//   PLUS the domain's own prior heads, so `EventLog.head()` naturally
//   resolves to the latest manifest and `since()` naturally computes
//   the minimal real update between two versions.
