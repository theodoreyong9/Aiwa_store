// How many peers a wallet keeps, and how it gets them. Meeting a stranger needs a rendezvous (a Trystero room, through a public relay); once
// a wallet has some peers it no longer needs one: it asks them to introduce it to the peers they know (Introducer), which opens direct
// connections of its own, and when it has enough of those it leaves the room. If it falls too low it goes back.
//
//   target  direct connections that are enough: at this many the room is left (unless `stay`)
//   low     below this many direct connections the room is joined again
//   stay    a machine that is always on stays in the room, so that a newcomer always finds someone: this is what a keeper is
//   anchor  the wallet with the lowest id among those in the room never leaves it: every wallet reaches the same answer from the same list,
//           so the room is never emptied by everyone leaving at once (a newcomer always finds at least that one)
//   roomMin the room is left only if at least this many other wallets are in it: a thin room is one that someone has to stay in, and the
//           wallets that go are not all the same ones at once (each waits a random while, then looks again)
//
// "Direct" means a connection of the by-hand kind (a WebrtcTransport link), whether it was made with two codes or by an introduction:
// it does not depend on the room, so it outlives it. A link made through the room ends when the room is left.
