// Turns "a bundle was published and can be reconstructed" into "a
// browser can actually run it": a real service worker's own fetch
// handler, resolving requests under a given scope from a real,
// locally-reconstructed AIWA bundle (aiwa-core's real IndexedDB-backed
// EventLog + this package's own latestBundle) instead of the network.
//
// A fresh EventLog is constructed on every single resolution, on
// purpose: a service worker's own real lifecycle is "the browser kills
// and restarts it whenever it wants" — there is no long-lived instance
// to hold state in. This only works correctly because EventLog.head()
// (and therefore latestBundle) is itself correct from a fresh instance
// over a persisted backend — see aiwa-core's own README for the real
// restart bug this used to have, found while building this file.
//
// HONEST LIMIT: this resolves and serves; it does not bootstrap itself
// into existence. The very first HTML page and this worker script
// itself still have to be fetched from *somewhere* the first time —
// see this package's own README, "the bootstrap problem", deliberately
// not solved here.
