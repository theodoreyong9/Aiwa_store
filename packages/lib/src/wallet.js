// The real, developer-facing AIWA wallet facade: composes aiwa-core's
// already-existing identity/wallet/accrual/conservation reducers and
// aiwa-platform's already-existing transport/replicator into the
// handful of calls a wallet UI actually needs — connect/disconnect,
// address, balance, claimable, claim, send, receive, plus a fully
// offline send/receive path (QR/NFC/Bluetooth — no network at all).
//
// This is deliberately thin: every real financial rule (reward curve,
// conservation, double-spend prevention) lives in aiwa-core, unchanged
// and independently tested there. This file only orchestrates real
// calls into it — it never reimplements or approximates the math.
//
// A single real Ed25519 keypair serves as BOTH your Solana address and
// your AIWA identity (same curve — see aiwa-core's own toIdentity()).
// "Connect"/"disconnect" here means unlocking/clearing that keypair in
// memory; it is a SEPARATE concept from joinNetwork()/leaveNetwork()
// (a live P2P session) — your own already-synced local data (address,
// balance, claimable) is always available fully offline, whether or
// not a network session is active, exactly as a real wallet's own
// local state should be.
//
// HONEST LIMIT: `rewardParams` ({alpha, beta, gamma, C, minQ}) is a
// real deployment's own chosen economic parameters — this file never
// invents a default for them. HONEST LIMIT: `claimable()` reflects
// real elapsed protocol epochs (aiwa-core's own progression.js, driven
// by real VDF proofs) — a domain that has never had a real progression
// event recorded stays at epoch 0 and never accrues anything to claim,
// regardless of how much real wall-clock time passes; wiring a real,
// continuous VDF-computing loop is a separate, not-yet-built piece
// (see this repo's own README).

   * found via this exact scenario: aiwa-core's own progressionParents()
   * can add a domain's last progression id as an EXTRA parent whenever
   * it isn't already the head, and that edge reaches straight past a
   * heads-only exclusion boundary back into already-covered territory —
   * collectAncestors would then re-walk and re-fold an already-covered
   * event, which aiwa-core's own causal-chain check then rejects as
   * "already advanced past this epoch"). Bounded by real activity since
   * the last checkpoint, not all-time history.
   *
   * On the very first call this session (no cache yet), also checks
   * for a real, self-authored checkpoint (aiwa-core's own

   * persist {heads, state} itself, e.g. to IndexedDB, and seed a fresh
   * instance's own _materializedState/_materializedHeads from it).
   * HONEST LIMIT: two overlapping, un-awaited calls can race — whichever
